TODO:

Up Next:
Walls
Make WorldGen cooler
Add different biomes (either as part of one map, or dedicate an entire map to one biome (preferred))
Add stars and clouds, fix the ugly mountains texture

add public boolean in EntityManager that tracks whether or not the tile that the mouse is in also collides with an entity. use this for checking if tiles can be placed

SpawnTile
Add an entity that tracks if a player placed a tile in it, and if so, set the spawn point to the players current position

Player
make arm swing

Collisions:
fix jittery left side collisions on cricket
Water:
add shading for water
draws above literally everything except backgrounds

Fixes:
Drawing order for sprites
design better damage system
Implement tile culling

Features:
add equipment (maybe make accessories input handlers, and store them in a list and call them before calling the players input)
Add doors
walls
projectiles
Ambitious Features:
Split Screen

UI: 
if inventory was open on death, reopen it when you respawn
draw map to a render target2D the size of the map. 
Only draw to this render target when the map is updated, and draw the pixels at the coresponding positions.

Drawing Order:
player and entities draw above tiles, unless bool is set
item drops draw above everything
player draws above all enemies

Change TileData to abstract, and just implement each one seperately instead of the overriding mess I currently have.

export tileUpdating to UpdateTileFunction in WorldGen, Update tiles when liquid is set, for removal of tiles like grass or torches.

player inventory and world are tied together
